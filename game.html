            <p class="text"> Strong willed and forceful, Shizune is
                definitely the leader type. She’s been
                the class rep, despite being deaf and
                mute, for as long as her class has had
                one, and generally takes charge in just
                about any situation she’s placed in.
                Shizune is known around the school
                as a fearsome taskmaster, and skilled
                manipulator, but also as a fair and just
                leader. </p>
